# GravityTile - MakerHacks 2025 First Place

# TileMate is a multi-functional smart flooring system that:

Generates energy from footsteps using electromagnetic induction.
Tracks movement in real time, allowing for activity monitoring.
Detects falls instantly, sending alerts to caregivers or emergency responders.
Enhances energy efficiency, repurposing generated electricity for household use.
Improves traffic prediction models by analyzing pedestrian and vehicle movement patterns.
By combining energy harvesting, real-time tracking, and intelligent detection, TileMate creates smarter homes and cities.

# How we built it
We combined physics, engineering, and software to develop TileMate:

Physics & Circuitry: Using Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction, we optimized power generation by adjusting the number of coil loops, magnet speed, and coil area.
Hardware & Electronics: We designed a system where voltage generated by coils is read by a microcontroller, using a rectifier circuit to convert AC to DC for storage.
Software Implementation: We developed tracking algorithms that analyze which tiles are activated in sequence, allowing us to track movement and detect falls.
Our prototype showcases real-time energy harvesting and motion tracking, demonstrating TileMate’s potential for large-scale implementation.

# Challenges we ran into
Maximizing energy output: Optimizing coil and magnet configurations for efficient power generation was complex.
Ensuring accurate movement tracking: Differentiating between normal steps and falls required precise data analysis and filtering.
Scalability: Expanding the system for large-scale environments like roads and public spaces posed design and cost challenges.
Each of these obstacles pushed us to refine our design and improve our implementation.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
